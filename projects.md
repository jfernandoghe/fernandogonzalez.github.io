  - _Robust calibration in eye tracking_ [**[Preprint]**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332766503_Testing_Robust_Polynomial_Models_for_Eye_Tracker_Calibration) Several models of eye tracking calibration have been proposed, complex models need more information causing delay on in-use calibration. By following the Parsimony Principle -Occam's Razor- a simple yet accurate and precise calibration is obtained. <br/>
The main idea of this proposal is to compare models using selectors and summary statistics; to accurate determine the best model based on previous techniques. A random sample consensus algorithm is used to ensure robust estimation and evaluation of parameters.<br/>
The best model is selected by person and device; thus, providing personalized selection to a characterized sensor. 
  - _Pattern detection in eye tracking_ Pattern detection is obtain by raw-data eye tracking -differing from common approaches- enhancing accuracy and precision by decomposing eye tracking scanpaths into sub-sequences -q-grams- providing with a least common sub-sequence (LCS) metric.<br/>
In essence, this algorithm uses raw coordinates (x,y) from eye tracking, decomposing onto q-grams or n-sub sequences of q length. Then, compares each query sub-sequence with the equivalence of the pattern creating a robust metric that finds equivalence between a query and a pattern.
  - _Wilderness Search-and-Rescue_ [**[Paper]**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8665267) A multi-agent search-and-rescue algorithm is develop; agents (as a UAV drone simulation) search for a reward (person) in a given environment. This heuristic metric is simulated with given traits of a particular person and UAV; outperforming sweeping algorithms (Spiral, Lawnmower, Uniform Circular Sector).<br/>
This algorithms ensures neither of the agents explore the same territory on the same period of time, most of the area is covered, attraction to high-probability areas; the results show that a reduction in time is achieved with 2-5 agents versus common techniques.
